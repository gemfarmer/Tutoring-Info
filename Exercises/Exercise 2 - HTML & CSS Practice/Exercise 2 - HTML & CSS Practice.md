## Exercise 2: HTML & CSS Practice + Box Model


Write a purpose statement for a mock web page you will be creating. e.g. "An ecommerce site for dolphin accessories" or "A gallery of my aunt's horse shows."

Following your purpose statement, build a site that uses each (or most) of the following elements at least once. You may create any number of pages to do this.

* doctype, html, head, body
* title, meta
* div, span
* p, a, h1-h6, img, em, strong, del, ins, br, hr
* header, footer, section, article, aside, nav
* address, blockquote, abbr, caption, cite, q, sup, time
* ul, ol, li, dl, dt, dd, pre, code
* table, thead, tbody, tfoot, th, tr, td, colgroup, col
* form, input, label, fieldset, select, textarea, button
Other tags you should be aware of:

* link, script
* video, iframe


#### Use Semantic Mark-up
In the computer programming world semantic mark-up refers to html tags that specifically describe a certain functionality that you want. While it would be possible to make an entire website using only div tags or custom element tags (you could make a `<jack></jack>` tag), using these elements will give you a huge leg-up if they are used correctly as all of the above elements come pre-packaged with a variety of css stylings and javascript functionality attached to them. Use that to your advantage. Inspect the element and see what styling the particular tag comes with.

#### Style that Sh@%!
Then, when you are ready, go nuts and style to your hearts content.
Style the elements using most of or all of the following css styles

* color, font-family, font-size, font-style, font-weight, text-decoration, text-transform
* white-space, text-align, text-indent, line-height, letter-spacing, vertical-align
* margin, padding, border, border-width, border-style, border-color, width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, max-height, overflow
* display, position, top, right, bottom, left, float, clear, z-index, visibility
* background, background-attachment, background-color, background-image, background-position, background-repeat
* list-style, list-style-type, list-style-position, list-style-image
* border-collapse, border-spacing


This isn't the most important exercise, but have fun with it. If you aren't having fun, put it on pause and come back to it later. There is no rush on this. These are essential fundamentals that you will want to and need to learn anyway you slice it.

#### Box Model
If the internet is a series of tubes, a website is just a bunch of boxes! The box model is the basis for how each element is displayed on the screen. Be sure to check out the link for it below and be familiar with the general concept of elements as boxes.
