## Exercise 1: Card Flip
#### Dear Jack and Selby,
* We are going to start with what might seem like a basic exercise, but will be a good, and potentially difficult introduction to HTML and CSS.
* If HTML is the structure of a website, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the way you style and (sometimes) animate things.

* For this exercise, you will create a series of card with pictures in them. When you hover over that image, the card should flip to reveal a solid backing.

1. Use the code [here](https://github.com/gemfarmer/Tutoring-Info/blob/master/Resources/html5-boilerplate) to start a basic html-compatible document.
2. In the same folder, create a css file called main.css
3. Add a reference to that css file by adding a link tag: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">` This will will reference any styling you have and apply it to html elements when you reference them
4. If you have any questions, feel free to email me or gchat me and I'll get back to you asap


* Note: This is a LOT to throw at you right away, even if it might appear basic, this will likely be a difficult assignment

* Here is a [Solution](https://github.com/gemfarmer/refactoru_card-flip/blob/master/index.html), though PLEASE try to struggle for a significant period before checking this out. Struggle is a huge part of the development process. You need to learn to manage your frustration (so that you don't throw your computer out the window or go on a killing rampage)
